NOTES
=====

This is a brief guide to the compilation of the MSRP (Message
Session Relay Protocol) library, according to draft specifications
(attached), and of the test programs that has been made available
to show its use. This library is currently being used in the
Confiance conferencing framework (http://confiance.sourceforge.net/)
to provide MSRP support.

This guide has been conceived by installing the applications on
a Linux RedHat Fedora Core 6, but it should not give any problem
on different distributions.

A Windows version of the library is still not available due
to some non-portable methods being currently used (e.g. socketpair)
but it soon will. If you make a Win32 version of the library by
fixing the current issues, please let me know at

========================
1. Compiling the library
========================

Edit the Makefile according to your settings and compiler.
By default gcc will be used, and the library installed
to /usr as destination prefix (/usr/include, /usr/lib).

To compile the library, type:

	make so

This will build the shared object for the library.
To install it, type, as root:

	make install

If you want to compile the test executables for the library,
type:

	make test

This will build two executables:

	- endpointmsrp, which will enable you to access the
			MSRP functionality as an endpoint
			(e.g. an IM client);
	- switchmsrp,	which will enable you to create an
			MSRP switch (i.e. a conference room).


==================================
2. Testing the library as endpoint
==================================

To test the endpoint functionality, launch the endpointmsrp
executable. This test application will need a text file
containing some basic configuration settings. A sample
is in the conf subdirectory (conf/endpoint.conf):

	- debug:	if you set debug to 1, you'll get
			many notifications printed on screen,
			both for log messages and errors.
			By default it is 0.
	- callid:	this is the Call-ID of the SIP session
			the MSRP connection will be associated
			with. Since this is an example, no
			SIP/SDP negotiation happens, so we
			pass it here.
	- label:	this is the label associated with the
			MSRP media stream in SDP, if needed.
			As before, this is a fake value.
	- active:	a 0 value means a passive endpoint (act
			as MSRP server and wait for the connection
			from the negotiated MSRP peer), while
			a 1 value means an active endpoint (act
			as a clint, and connect to the negotiated
			peer). For a correct behaviour of the library,
			the server should know both the peers
			(i.e. itself, 'From', and the client, 'To')
			before the client does, since the client
			will connect as soon as msrp_endpoint_set_to
			is called.
	- address:	this is the address the MSRP library will
			use to build the endpoint's MSRP path.
	- port:		this is the port number the endpoint will
			bind to. This is true for both servers and
			clients, since they get negotiated via SDP.
			if set to 0, a random port number will be
			chosen by the library. Once the endpoint
			binds to the port, this port is used to
			build the endpoint's MSRP path.
	- display:	the nickname to be used. This is only for
			visualization purposes (i.e. it is local
			to the application), since MSRP uses SIP
			display identifiers as nicknames.

A typical example to try the application is to have two endpoints
talking to each other. Setup two different configuration files,
one active and one passive, and then launch two instances of
the application, e.g.:

	./endpointmsrp alice.conf

with alice.conf (server endpoint, active is 0):

	debug=0
	call_id=3413an89KU
	label=11
	active=0
	address=127.0.0.1
	port=0
	display=Alice

and:

	./endpointmsrp bob.conf

with alice.conf (client endpoint, active is 1):

	debug=0
	call_id=3413an89KU
	label=22
	active=1
	address=127.0.0.1
	port=8888
	display=Bob

The call-IDs in real world scenarios will typically be the same,
since they will identify a SIP session. Since no actual SDP
negotiation is involved, it will be simulated through console
interaction. 
Once the server starts, you'll see something like this:

	Configuration file: alice.conf
		Debug:          no
		Call-ID:        3413an89KU
		Label:          11
		Active:         no
		Address:        127.0.0.1
		Port:           0
		Display:        Alice
		No 'port' in alice.conf, choosing random one
	
	MSRP library initialized.
	New endpoint (ID 1) created:
		Call-ID:        3413an89KU
		Label:          11
		From:           msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp (passive)

We wanted a random port, and 2832 has been taken. Besides, a
random session identifier has been picked up (1e4d2c216b02).
As a result, the 'From' string identifies Alice's MSRP path.

On the client side:

	Configuration file: bob.conf
		Debug:          no
		Call-ID:        3413an89KU
		Label:          22
		Active:         yes
		Address:        127.0.0.1
		Port:           8888
		Display:        Bob
	
	MSRP library initialized.
	New endpoint (ID 1) created:
		Call-ID:        n89KU3413a
		Label:          22
		From:           msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp (active)

We wanted for Bob to explicitely bind to 8888, and it has
been done. A random session identifier has been picked up
(5ff8dd6225c1), and as before the 'From' string identifies
Bob's MSRP path.

Now that both endpoints have a valid MSRP path, they'll need
to exchange it with each other to start to communicate. This
is typically done by means of a SIP/SDP offer/answer negotiation
mechanism. Since it is only simulated here, take Bob's path
(the client) and pass it to Alice:

	Insert your peer's nickname (for visualization only): Bob
	Insert the full 'To' path: msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp
		To:             msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp (active)

Setting the peer has made the server start listening on the port.
Now take Alice's path (the server) and pass it to Bob:

	Insert your peer's nickname (for visualization only): Alice
	Insert the full 'To' path: msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp
	Endpoint 1: we connected towards 'To' (msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp)
		To:             msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp (passive)

As you can see, setting the peer made the client connect to it.
In fact, in Alice's application you can see:

	Endpoint 1: 'To' connected to us (msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp)

At this point, the two MSRP endpoints are connected, and can start
chatting. A disconnection of one of the peers will be notified to
the other.

Have a look at the code to see how all this can be accomplished
using the MSRP library.


================================
3. Testing the library as switch
================================

The library can act as an MSRP switch as well. Switching means
having a single listening MSRP path to which other active endpoints
connect to: each message an endpoint will send will then be
forwarded to all the other attached endpoints. This switch
functionality implements an MSRP conference chat room.
Announcements (both to a single endpoint or to all endpoints)
can be made on a switch. Besides, moderation is envisaged: this is
accomplished on the application side, to allow for example floor
control to decide who can talk and who can't.

To test the switching functionality, launch the switchmsrp
executable. This test application will need a text file
containing some basic configuration settings. A sample
is in the conf subdirectory (conf/switch.conf):

	- debug:	if you set debug to 1, you'll get
			many notifications printed on screen,
			both for log messages and errors.
			By default it is 0.
	- welcome:	this is a welcome message that is
			sent as an announcement to a user
			as soon as she/he joins the conference
			room. This of course is not the default
			behavior of the library, and is only
			there to show the single announcement
			feature.
	- address:	this is the address the MSRP library will
			use to build the switch's MSRP path.
	- port:		this is the port number the switch will
			bind to and listen on as a server.
			If set to 0, a random port number will be
			chosen by the library. Once the switch
			binds to the port, this port is used to
			build the conference MSRP path.

A typical example to try the application is to have two or more
endpoints talking to each other on the same chat room. Setup 
different configuration files for the endpoints as described
previously. They will need to be setup as active, of course,
since the switch will be the server. Then prepare a configuration
file for the switch and launch it:

	./switchmsrp switch.conf

with switch.conf:

	debug=0
	welcome=Welcome to this sample MSRP conference
	address=127.0.0.1
	port=0

After launched, a menu with several options will appear.
Use the "Add User" voice to add endpoints to the conference,
by following the same guidelines of the previous section:
in this scenario, all endpoints will have the same endpoint
(the switch) as server peer (which before was Alice).

Have a look at the code to see how an MSRP conference room
service can be accomplished using the library.
