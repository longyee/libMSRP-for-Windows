<p>This is a brief guide to the compilation of the MSRP (Message
Session Relay Protocol) library, according to draft specifications
(attached), and of the test programs that has been made available
to show its use. This library is currently being used in the
Confiance conferencing framework (<a href="http://confiance.sourceforge.net/">http://confiance.sourceforge.net/</a>)
to provide MSRP support.</p>

<p>This guide has been conceived by installing the applications on
a Linux RedHat Fedora Core 6, but it should not give any problem
on different distributions.</p>

<p>A Windows version of the library is still not available due
to some non-portable methods being currently used (e.g. socketpair)
but it soon will. If you make a Win32 version of the library by
fixing the current issues, please let me know at</p>

<a id="1-compiling-the-library" class="anchor" href="#1-compiling-the-library" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Compiling the library</h1>

<p>Edit the Makefile according to your settings and compiler.
By default gcc will be used, and the library installed
to /usr as destination prefix (/usr/include, /usr/lib).</p>

<p>To compile the library, type:</p>

<pre><code>make so
</code></pre>

<p>This will build the shared object for the library.
To install it, type, as root:</p>

<pre><code>make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to compile the test executables for the library,
type:</p>

<pre><code>make test
</code></pre>

<p>This will build two executables:</p>

<pre><code>- endpointmsrp, which will enable you to access the
        MSRP functionality as an endpoint
        (e.g. an IM client);
- switchmsrp,   which will enable you to create an
        MSRP switch (i.e. a conference room).
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a id="2-testing-the-library-as-endpoint" class="anchor" href="#2-testing-the-library-as-endpoint" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Testing the library as endpoint</h1>

<p>To test the endpoint functionality, launch the endpointmsrp
executable. This test application will need a text file
containing some basic configuration settings. A sample
is in the conf subdirectory (conf/endpoint.conf):</p>

<pre><code>- debug:    if you set debug to 1, you'll get
        many notifications printed on screen,
        both for log messages and errors.
        By default it is 0.
- callid:   this is the Call-ID of the SIP session
        the MSRP connection will be associated
        with. Since this is an example, no
        SIP/SDP negotiation happens, so we
        pass it here.
- label:    this is the label associated with the
        MSRP media stream in SDP, if needed.
        As before, this is a fake value.
- active:   a 0 value means a passive endpoint (act
        as MSRP server and wait for the connection
        from the negotiated MSRP peer), while
        a 1 value means an active endpoint (act
        as a clint, and connect to the negotiated
        peer). For a correct behaviour of the library,
        the server should know both the peers
        (i.e. itself, 'From', and the client, 'To')
        before the client does, since the client
        will connect as soon as msrp_endpoint_set_to
        is called.
- address:  this is the address the MSRP library will
        use to build the endpoint's MSRP path.
- port:     this is the port number the endpoint will
        bind to. This is true for both servers and
        clients, since they get negotiated via SDP.
        if set to 0, a random port number will be
        chosen by the library. Once the endpoint
        binds to the port, this port is used to
        build the endpoint's MSRP path.
- display:  the nickname to be used. This is only for
        visualization purposes (i.e. it is local
        to the application), since MSRP uses SIP
        display identifiers as nicknames.
</code></pre>

<p>A typical example to try the application is to have two endpoints
talking to each other. Setup two different configuration files,
one active and one passive, and then launch two instances of
the application, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>./endpointmsrp alice.conf
</code></pre>

<p>with alice.conf (server endpoint, active is 0):</p>

<pre><code>debug=0
call_id=3413an89KU
label=11
active=0
address=127.0.0.1
port=0
display=Alice
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>./endpointmsrp bob.conf
</code></pre>

<p>with alice.conf (client endpoint, active is 1):</p>

<pre><code>debug=0
call_id=3413an89KU
label=22
active=1
address=127.0.0.1
port=8888
display=Bob
</code></pre>

<p>The call-IDs in real world scenarios will typically be the same,
since they will identify a SIP session. Since no actual SDP
negotiation is involved, it will be simulated through console
interaction. 
Once the server starts, you'll see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Configuration file: alice.conf
    Debug:          no
    Call-ID:        3413an89KU
    Label:          11
    Active:         no
    Address:        127.0.0.1
    Port:           0
    Display:        Alice
    No 'port' in alice.conf, choosing random one

MSRP library initialized.
New endpoint (ID 1) created:
    Call-ID:        3413an89KU
    Label:          11
    From:           msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp (passive)
</code></pre>

<p>We wanted a random port, and 2832 has been taken. Besides, a
random session identifier has been picked up (1e4d2c216b02).
As a result, the 'From' string identifies Alice's MSRP path.</p>

<p>On the client side:</p>

<pre><code>Configuration file: bob.conf
    Debug:          no
    Call-ID:        3413an89KU
    Label:          22
    Active:         yes
    Address:        127.0.0.1
    Port:           8888
    Display:        Bob

MSRP library initialized.
New endpoint (ID 1) created:
    Call-ID:        n89KU3413a
    Label:          22
    From:           msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp (active)
</code></pre>

<p>We wanted for Bob to explicitely bind to 8888, and it has
been done. A random session identifier has been picked up
(5ff8dd6225c1), and as before the 'From' string identifies
Bob's MSRP path.</p>

<p>Now that both endpoints have a valid MSRP path, they'll need
to exchange it with each other to start to communicate. This
is typically done by means of a SIP/SDP offer/answer negotiation
mechanism. Since it is only simulated here, take Bob's path
(the client) and pass it to Alice:</p>

<pre><code>Insert your peer's nickname (for visualization only): Bob
Insert the full 'To' path: msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp
    To:             msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp (active)
</code></pre>

<p>Setting the peer has made the server start listening on the port.
Now take Alice's path (the server) and pass it to Bob:</p>

<pre><code>Insert your peer's nickname (for visualization only): Alice
Insert the full 'To' path: msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp
Endpoint 1: we connected towards 'To' (msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp)
    To:             msrp://127.0.0.1:2832/1e4d2c216b02;tcp (passive)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, setting the peer made the client connect to it.
In fact, in Alice's application you can see:</p>

<pre><code>Endpoint 1: 'To' connected to us (msrp://127.0.0.1:8888/5ff8dd6225c1;tcp)
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, the two MSRP endpoints are connected, and can start
chatting. A disconnection of one of the peers will be notified to
the other.</p>

<p>Have a look at the code to see how all this can be accomplished
using the MSRP library.</p>

<a id="3-testing-the-library-as-switch" class="anchor" href="#3-testing-the-library-as-switch" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Testing the library as switch</h1>

<p>The library can act as an MSRP switch as well. Switching means
having a single listening MSRP path to which other active endpoints
connect to: each message an endpoint will send will then be
forwarded to all the other attached endpoints. This switch
functionality implements an MSRP conference chat room.
Announcements (both to a single endpoint or to all endpoints)
can be made on a switch. Besides, moderation is envisaged: this is
accomplished on the application side, to allow for example floor
control to decide who can talk and who can't.</p>

<p>To test the switching functionality, launch the switchmsrp
executable. This test application will need a text file
containing some basic configuration settings. A sample
is in the conf subdirectory (conf/switch.conf):</p>

<pre><code>- debug:    if you set debug to 1, you'll get
        many notifications printed on screen,
        both for log messages and errors.
        By default it is 0.
- welcome:  this is a welcome message that is
        sent as an announcement to a user
        as soon as she/he joins the conference
        room. This of course is not the default
        behavior of the library, and is only
        there to show the single announcement
        feature.
- address:  this is the address the MSRP library will
        use to build the switch's MSRP path.
- port:     this is the port number the switch will
        bind to and listen on as a server.
        If set to 0, a random port number will be
        chosen by the library. Once the switch
        binds to the port, this port is used to
        build the conference MSRP path.
</code></pre>

<p>A typical example to try the application is to have two or more
endpoints talking to each other on the same chat room. Setup 
different configuration files for the endpoints as described
previously. They will need to be setup as active, of course,
since the switch will be the server. Then prepare a configuration
file for the switch and launch it:</p>

<pre><code>./switchmsrp switch.conf
</code></pre>

<p>with switch.conf:</p>

<pre><code>debug=0
welcome=Welcome to this sample MSRP conference
address=127.0.0.1
port=0
</code></pre>

<p>After launched, a menu with several options will appear.
Use the "Add User" voice to add endpoints to the conference,
by following the same guidelines of the previous section:
in this scenario, all endpoints will have the same endpoint
(the switch) as server peer (which before was Alice).</p>

<p>Have a look at the code to see how an MSRP conference room
service can be accomplished using the library.</p>
